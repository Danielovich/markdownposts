One of the more context-aware abilities when solving a challenge is balancing complexity with appealing to a lower common denominator. I'm not sure if my phrasing is entirely accurate, but I'll leave it for now.

My experience tells me that in any field, the expected up-front complexity simultaneously increases the price and costs, either initially or over time. This might seem like a no-brainer, but the question is what positive side effects reduced complexity offers you.

- It is easier to make a yeast dough than a sourdough
- It is easier to maintain a fiberglass boat than a wooden one
- It is easier to make pasta alla norma than bouillabaisse
- It is easier to get around by bike than by car
- It is easier to set up a wind farm than a nuclear power plant

There are a lot of underlying things here that I'm fully aware exist - for instance, fiberglass doesn't make itself. Or that nuclear power is a more stable base-load technology because it works even when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. But I think you understand what I'm trying to say.

"It is easier" naturally also applies to software.

I think it's important, at least for myself, not to view increased complexity as a stamp of higher quality. Quite the opposite, in fact. I don't get a better product by using more complex technology, exclusive ingredients, or titanium. Unless I am 100% aware of why I need to use these. But then I usually pay a higher price for this increased complexity.

Therefore, getting the balance right is also important. In other words, you need to be meticulous about the question of why.

- I make yeast dough because my guests can't taste the difference between it and sourdough anyway
- I sail in a fiberglass boat because I don't want to maintain a wooden one
- I make pasta alla norma when the kids are home and I'm tired after a long day
- I make bouillabaisse when I have plenty of time and I know it will be appreciated by others
- I bike in the city but drive by car when traveling far

It's actually fun to take your own statements and try to think about what they "cost" up-front, what their relative price is over time, and also what they give back, both up-front and over time.

Is it really that different from:

- It is easier to write a switch statement than a factory
- It is easier to write text than HTML
- It is easier to read and write in the same method than using commands and queries
- It is easier to deploy via "git push" than with FTP
- It is easier to write code when you know the expectations
- It is easier to use a cloud provider than to host yourself

You don't need to question whether these statements are easier or not - they are merely trying to state a few examples - but you should think carefully when making choices and on what basis you make them.
