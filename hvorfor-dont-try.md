# "Don't Try" ?

> Published on Jun 6, 2021

Somebody asked me: "What do you do? How do you write, create?" 

You don't, I told them. You don't try. 

That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality.

You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. 

It's like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. 

When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. 

Or if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.
