### When Technology Overshadows the Social in Software Development

In the world around the individualism of software enginnering and programming one sometimes need what cyclists calls "an excersise adjustment". Technology often takes center stage. Socalled new frameworks, never-ending disussions around paradigms, and tools that promise to optimize, streamline, and solve complex problems. 

Lately I have watched four real human beings, working together for weeks, to develop an algoritihm. Sitting in the same room. Churning. Talking. Discussing. Sharing knowledge. Using social skills. Increasing cognitive safety for domain understanding. In my book, that is team work. Funny enough others around this group has expressed their interest wanting to be part of such a tightly knit setting.

In our pursuit of technical solutions, we often overlook the social aspects that are crucial to building successful teams and organizations. Why do you think this happens ? And what are the consequences for the humans alongside you ?

As a programmer, I frequently find myself wondering why the social aspects of our field are so hard to come by — even though practiced they are seldom practiced for lengths at a time, and in my experience, they are often replaced by an individualistic approach to power and decision-making. I've seen plenty of times, teams operate on unvalidated information, following a single person's "good idea", often driven by some sort of "HIPO", seniority or status. This dynamic is compounded by the way many companies organize themselves, creating an environment that does not support healthy social activities for teamwork, collaboration, and feedback.


### The Allure of Technology

It's common for both programmers and managers to attempt to solve organizational issues by implementing new technologies. There’s a tendency to believe that tools like technology can drive and can resolve deeper, more fundamental collaboration problems. But this reinforces a theory I’ve long held: we misunderstand the role that technology plays within our organizations.

A well-intentioned but purely technological approach can easily overlook the social structures needed to foster healthy teams. We become trapped in a mindset that assumes technological design will naturally create the right conditions for better collaboration and outcomes. This is a short-sighted solution that focuses only on the tools and not on how people actually work together.

### Who Holds the Power?

Power dynamics in an organization play a crucial role in how decisions are made and which solutions are chosen. I recently encountered a manager in a ten-person team who believed that there was no time for code reviews. This might seem as both an easy fix and a shit for brains stance, but in real life you encounter organisations and people that hold power they will not democratize. Being afraid of loosing that power grip is a real thing in some humans.

This is also a perfect example of how one person’s decision can shape an entire team's working processes. Code reviews are not just a technical step toward better code quality; they are also an opportunity for learning, feedback, and collaboration. When social mechanisms like these are removed from the process, you lose the relational dynamics that can strengthen a team.

If we up the ante and instead add a deeper rooted decision, that could have a more profound effect on a team, then we simply complicate matters even further.

I have no negative opinions towards e.g. DDD or Event-sourcing, but imagine the power dynamics of making such a choice without understanding the underlying organisational conflicts that coulda also add. The higher the complexity the more social stability within your organisation is probably needed.

This is where we often see a conflict between technology and social structures. Many of us in the tech world are influenced by a bias that leads us to believe technical solutions are always the answer. Jeff Hodges’ article, [Notes on Distributed Systems for Young Bloods](https://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/), encapsulates this well: “Our background, education, and experience bias us towards a technical solution even when a social solution would be more efficient, and more pleasing. Let’s try to correct for that.”

### Technology and Social Dynamics: Two Sides of the Same Coin

I believe the biggest challenge in modern software development is not about choosing technologies or paradigms. It lies in creating the right conditions for teams to thrive both socially and technologically. That's different from the technological direction. We can’t ignore the social dynamics that arise within teams, organizations, and leadership. Technology is not a replacement for relationships, communication, and trust. And it shouldn't be neither the bearer of it nor a parameter for successful team work. 

When organizations attempt to improve their outcomes by implementing new technologies without considering how those technologies will be socially integrated, they risk creating more chaos than clarity. The social architecture of an organization is just as important as its technical architecture. Ignoring this leads us to listen to those who talk the loudest and the most, rather than establishing best insights through information, measurements and team work.

Personally I would much rather be part of a reflective and social organization than a technology-driven one. This is where I have experienced teams build the most sustainable, resilient and quality work and at same time been the best place to be as a human.
